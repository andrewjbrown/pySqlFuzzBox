This is a basic tool to take a series of SQL files and push them as "clients" connecting to the postgres server.
The payloads will exist as sql files that can be loaded at random or by choice of the user.

So far we use basic threads as each "client" and they will connect to their own postgresql stream.

Nothing is done.
